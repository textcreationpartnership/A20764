            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>But before we come to intreate of theſe parts particularly, we may generally obſerue that the holy Ghoſt ſhewing the bleſſedneſſe of a godly man, doth make it to conſiſt as much in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and vertuous actions, as in his priuiledges and rewards. From whence we learne, that we are as happy in our graces and good workes, as in the prerogatiues and rewards which doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them. The which is manifeſt both by plaine teſtimonies of Scriptures, and by euident reaſons, grounded vpon them.

                  <p>In reſpect of the former, it is ſaid that the godly and bleſſed man <hi>giueth to the poore, Dat non profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> he giueth but not waſteth, he ſo giueth as that he may ſtill giue, and becauſe <hi>it is a more bleſſed thing to giue, then to receiue and craue,</hi> he preſerueth the ſtocke and ſtore houſe of his bountie, that by continuall giuing hee may continue his greater bleſſedneſſe. So the Apoſtle appointing a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for the Saints, inioyneth euery <hi>one to lay vp in ſtore as God hath proſpered him.</hi> Euery one <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1.</note>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:10738:14"/> therefore in his almeſdeedes, is to reſpect his own abilitie, and to giue neither aboue nor vnder his meanes. The which a man obſerueth, when as he ſo giueth, as that he may be able to hold on in the ſame proportion, and that rather with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe then abatement.

How be it this rule houldeth onely in ordinary, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſitie of the poore (as wee ſhall ſee <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 5.</note> hereafter) and the generall neceſſitie of the Church, bring a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> and diſpence with it; as we may ſee in the Acts of the Apoſtles, where the Saints that had houſes and lands, fould them, that they might thereby ſupply the great wants of the faithful liuing vnder grieuous perſecution, the neceſſitie of the times vrging and requiring it. The which was not proper to thoſe times, but ſhould now alſo be put in practiſe, vpon the like occaſion.</p>

                  <p>And therefore as the godly and bleſſedman doth in his giuing almes auoide that extreame of exceſſe, ſo much more the contrary extreame of defect; and chooſeth rather to offend on the ſaufer ſide; becauſe it is better the poore man ſhould take a ſlight ſurfet, through too much fulneſſe, then to be pinched and famiſhed for want of neceſſaries; and that the mercifull mans almes ſhould aſpire to the title of bountie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence, then to bee abaſed with the name of neereneſſe and niggardly hardneſſe.</p>

                  <p>But this will more plainely appeare by that which followeth in the deſcription, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the true fountaine out of which almeſdeedes flow, as faith, obedience, charitie, mercy; all which being proper to the godly Chriſtian, it followeth that theſe workes of mercy be alſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar vnto him. Firſt then our almes are to ariſe from a liuely faith, which formalizeth all the Chriſtians actions, and putteth the maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene their workes and the ſame works done by worldlings. For firſt we are aſſured that God is good vnto vs, before we can ſhew any goodneſſe towards our brethren; that he hath giuen vs all we haue, before we will part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for his ſake; that hee will giue vs all things which will make vs happy and glorious, before we will part with thoſe things wherein men place their worldly happineſſe.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10738:26"/> acceptable vnto God, or as will aſſure vs that we are godly and bleſſed: for to doe a worke in faith and approued in the ſight of God, is not onely to be truely perſwaded and aſſured, that the thing we doe is warranted by Gods word and allowed by him; but that we alſo in Chriſt are accepted of him, which faith being wanting it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that our beſt actions ſhould pleaſe God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are but ſinne, as the Apoſtle telleth <note place="margin">Heb. 11 6.

In reſpect of the firſt, wee muſt giue onely that which is our owne, by iuſt and lawfull means deriued vnto vs: as by inheritance, free gift or honeſt getting, by our owne painefull labours and endeauours. For almeſ-deedes are liberall gifts, whereby wee alienate the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the thing giuen from our ſelues, and not from other men, to the releefe of thoſe who ſtand in neede.

I anſwere it is true, for what can be more required then vſe, where there is no proprietie, but that which is in them both? yea but (ſay they) the proprietie is in the husband, and for the common vſe which the wife hath in her husbands goods, it onely extendeth to her meate, drinke, apparell, and ſuch neceſſaries as are fit for the maintenance of her perſon. The former hath ſome colour, becauſe the husband

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10738:49"/> ſay, that this maketh againſt mee, becauſe ſhee would not doe it of her ſelfe without her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands conſent; ſeeing no man euer dreamed that the wife ſhould take vpon her ſo to doe, if ſhee can poſſibly by any good meanes obtaine her husbands allowance.</p>

                  <p>And thus hauing vntyed the hardeſt knots in this controuerſie, and remoued the maine blocks which did lie in the way; the reaſons which may further be produced for the clearing of this point will finde a faire and eaſie entrance. And firſt, all good actions and workes of mercie are charged as well vpon the wife as the husband, and where any commaundement requiring them is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, it extendeth as well to the woman as the man: as namely relieuing the poore, feeding the hungrie, viſiting the ſicke, cloathing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, &amp; ſuch like, and therefore the wife is no leſſe bound to doe them than the husband, and liable to the ſame puniſhment if ſhe doe neglect them. yea not onely theſe good workes are generally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to all mankinde but eſpecially to this ſexe, as appeareth. 1.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10738:50"/> that which is in their poſſeſſion. And if they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that ſhee is inferiour to her husband and therefore muſt not doe any of theſe workes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent: I anſwere, that as ſhee is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to her husband, ſo both he and ſhe to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ſoueraigne, and therefore though ſhee is to ſhew ſubiection and yeeld obedience to her husband in all things lawfull and indifferent, yet not where God commandeth the contrary, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here the Apoſtles rule taketh place, that <hi>it is better to obey God then man.</hi> For he is the chiefe <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> Lord of all, and the husband but a ſteward and inferiour officer vnder him, to diſpoſe of his goods as he commaundeth, and to giue vnto his fellow-ſeruants their portion which belongeth vnto them: now if he neglect this duetie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all to his owne vſe like a miſer, or miſpend his maiſters goods in exceſſe and riot, the wife who is ioyned in commiſſion with him as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour officer is not to ioyne with him in theſe courſes and ſo make her ſelfe partaker of his ſinne and puniſhment, but to imploy that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her hand in her maiſters ſeruice, and to performe thoſe good duties to her fellow-ſeruants which he neglecteth.</p>

                  <p>Yea but the husband hath ſuch authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his wife, that though, in the time of the law ſhe ſhould make a vow vnto God, to conſecrate any thing vnto his ſeruice, it was in his power to diſanull and make it voide. To which I anſwere <note place="margin">Num. 30.</note> that vowes were either of things abſolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or of things indifferent, either in their

And not without good cauſe is it made a note of a gracious wife, becauſe almes deeds are ordinarily done out of houſhold ſtore and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, the adminiſtration and diſpoſing wherof doth more properly and immediately belong to the woman then to the man, as we may ſee by the current of that whole chapter. So the Apoſtle would haue the younger women to marry, beare children, and guide the houſe, 1. Tim. 5. 14. The which when the Husband alloweth, hee giueth honour to his wife; as the Apoſtle requireth 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. and contrariwiſe diſgraceth her when hee <note place="margin">1 Pet: 3. 7.</note> turneth her out of this her office &amp; viceregency. For as the man is the principall getter of the eſtate, and the bringer of it in, ſo the wiſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it for the good of the husband and familie, belongeth vnto the woman; not onely by ſpeciall commiſſion from him for euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and imployment, but as ſhe is a Wife by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of her calling, place and office; if at leaſt ſhe be not limitted and reſtrained for her miſgouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and want of diſcretion in abuſing and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending their eſtate, by the ſuperiour authority of her husband. And as in the common-wealth, the King, though he hath ſupreame authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all, yet doth not take vpon him to adminiſter all the affaires of the kingdome, but hath vnder him many inferiour officers, who by vertue of their place and office mannage great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affaires without any ſpeciall commiſſion for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10738:51"/> particular actions; and although hee hath euer in his hand a ſuperiour power ouer them, to call them to account, and to turne them out of their offices, when they miſ-behaue themſelues, and abuſe his name and authoritie; yet ſo long as they holde their place and office, they may iuſtly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the affaires and duties that belong vnto it: ſo is it alſo in the little common-wealth of the houſe and family; for when the husband hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a wife, the adminiſtration of houſhold affaires belongeth vnto her by vertue of her place and calling, vnleſſe ſhe be ſuſpended from this power and liberty, for her vniuſt and vndiſcreete abuſing of it; and for the husband to intermeddle more then neceſſity requireth with her domeſticall bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, is as if a King would be Chancelour, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, Cheife Iuſtice and all himſelfe, though hee had officers appoynted to all theſe places, which were but to ouerburthen himſelfe and abaſe his Royall condition, and alſo to wrong thoſe who are deputed to theſe offices, by diſtruſting cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly their fidelitie and ſufficiency.</p>

Yea in truth the wiues ſeruitude ſhould be farre worſe than of the meaneſt ſeruant; for it is the moſt grieuous bondage, to bee bound from doing good, and reſtrayned from expreſſing our good will by our workes and actions; now the pooreſt ſeruants may according to their ſmal eſtate, giue almes and doe good, out of that which is their owne and earned by their painfull labours; and ſo though they giue little, yet giuing according to their abilitie, they may (like the poore widdow that caſt in her mites) be rich in good works, and richly rewarded in the life to come; whereas the wife though ſhee haue neuer ſo much vnder her hand, yet may giue nothing of it, nor haue any libertie without licence, to expreſſe the bounty of her heart in the outward action; or if ſhee doe

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10738:53"/> which it is anſwered, that <hi>Abigails</hi> example is no rule for other women; for then by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſhould be lawfull to call their husbands fooles as ſhe did. But to this I reply, that we muſt diſtinguiſh betweene the infirmities ſhewed in the action, and the action it ſelfe; the infirmities and imperfections no man alloweth, but for the action it ſelfe it was good, and ſhee pronounced by holy <hi>Dauid</hi> bleſſed for it; yea he bleſſeth God as being the chiefe author who ſtirred her vp to the doing of this charitable action, v 32. <hi>Bleſſed be</hi>

And who giueth libertie vnto any other but vnto thoſe only, who are able to performe theſe actions vertuouſly and with ſome diſcretion? Thirdly, it is obiected that <hi>Naball</hi> was a churle and a foole, and therefore it was lawfull for his wife who was wiſer then he to diſpoſe of ſome part of his great eſtate. To which I reply that I giue no authoritie to wiues to giue againſt their husbands will, vnleſſe they be ſuch <hi>Naballs</hi> and wicked churles, who by no perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be drawne to the doing of any good. Yea but he muſt be not only a churle, but alſo a foole ſuch as <hi>Naball</hi> was. To which I anſwer, that who ſo doth well conſider <hi>Naballs</hi> anſwer to <hi>Dauids</hi> meſſengers, and compareth it with <hi>Dauids</hi> preſent eſtate, who with his company liued, in the ſight of carnall men, like fugitiues and out-lawes; he will finde more wickedneſſe in it, then want of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10738:53"/> worldly wit. Wickednes I ſay, becauſe hee did not (like his wife) beleeue Gods promiſes made to <hi>Dauid</hi> concerning his eſtabliſhment in the kingdome, when as he ſaw him in this afflicted eſtate. Secondly, becauſe therein hee ſheweth his churliſhnes &amp; auerſenes to any good, &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to releeue the diſtreſſed ſeruants of God, though he had abundance in his hands to beſtow ſuperfluouſly in riotous feaſting thoſe he fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Thirdly, that he was more wicked then wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, it appeareth by his ſeruants words to <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail,</hi> v. 17. who ſaid that he was <hi>ſuch a wicked perſon or ſonne of Belial that no man durſt ſpeake to him,</hi> whereas folly in the maſter worketh rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt than feare in the hearts of ſeruants; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by <hi>Abigail</hi> her words to <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ioyning his wickednes with his folly, ſheweth that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chiefly conſiſted in his wickedneſſe, &amp; though he might haue worldly wit, yet he was deſtitute of true ſpirituall wiſdome, which chiefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in godlineſſe and in the feare of the Lord. Neither do we leaue libertie to wiues to perform theſe workes of mercy without the allowance of their husbands, vnles they be ſuch fooles, that is, ſuch carnall worldlings as will neither themſelues doe good, nor by their good wills ſuffer others; for though theſe be not fooles and mad-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue the vſe of reaſon, yet are they fooliſh and mad in reſpect of chriſtianitie, ſeeing their reaſon is quite oppoſite and contrary to religion.</p>

                  <p>ANd ſo I come from the perſons, who are both to giue and receiue almes, to ſpeake of the maner how they may moſt conueniently be diſtributed. And this is either more publike and common; or more priuate and particular. In regard of the former the beſt courſe which we can take in giuing our almes, is to follow the lawes and cuſtome of our country; as among vs to put what we can ſpare into the poores box, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it to the Collectors for the poore, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed, as out of the common purſe, according to their diſcretion who are choſen to this office. And for our priuate almes which wee giue with our owne hands, we are to deliuer them to ſuch poore, as by our owne enquirie we haue found out to be honeſt and needy; or elſe to ſuch others as God by a more immediate prouidence doth vnexpectedly and extraordinarily offer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto vs for the exerciſe of our charitie.</p>

                  <p>As for the giuing of our almes at our dores to common beggers, though I doe not vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10738:62"/> this maner of giuing, whileſt ſufficient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not taken, and accordingly duely executed by the Magiſtrate, for the reformation of this diſorder; eſpecially when the whole ſtreame of mens charitie doth not runne this way, but ſome ſmall riuulet, or as it were ſome litle pipe or quill; and when this is giuen to thoſe who are in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent miſerie, as the aged and decerepit, the lame, ſicke and blinde, for the reliefe of their preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie; yet can I in no wiſe approue it, if after this maner only we exerciſe our mercy and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie giuing without difference to all that come to the dore, as vnto looſe and idle perſons, who are ſtrong and able to labor, &amp; common beggers and vagabonds, who liue by the ſweat of other mens browes. And my reaſons are, becauſe they who are truly poore ſhall by theſe meanes be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, whileſt theſe lazie drones deuoure that which of right belongeth vnto them. Secondly, thoſe who are bold, impudent, and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, will oftentimes ſpeed better then thoſe who are modeſt and ſhamefaſt. Thirdly, our almes ſhall by this meanes be diſtributed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out equalitie, ſome hauing all and ſome nothing; and without diſcretion, becauſe being giuen thus at random, they cannot be fitted to the quantitie or qualitie of their wants. Fourthly, this kinde of giuing, nouriſheth and increaſeth the number of vagrants and inordinate perſons, incouraging and heartning them to continue in their idle, lewd, and wicked courſes, without any feare of God or ſubiection vnto men. Fiftly, the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

And laſtly, thoſe excellent lawes, which haue lately beene made among vs, for the reforming this abuſe, are diſobeyed and tranſgreſſed; and ſo the chriſtian Magiſtrate iuſtly offended, whom we are bound to obey in all things lawfull or indifferent, and much more requiring ſuch things as are godly and commendable, as tending to Gods glory, the proſperous eſtate of the Church and common-wealth, and the great good of all particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

                  <p>And this ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The next point to be conſidered is the time when theſe almes-deeds are to bee performed; And that is in the whole courſe of our liues, when we haue abilitie, and finde fit oportunitie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe workes of mercy. But of this I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken, and therfore I will here only ſhew, what I thinke concerning thoſe almes-deeds and workes of mercy, which are not done in our life time, but by our laſt will and teſtament, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be done after the death of the benefactor. The which actions of liberalitie are to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and cenſured, according to the qualitie and condition of the perſons by whom they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10738:63"/> for either out of loue and obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and chriſtian charitie and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards men, they are done by ſuch as haue according to their abilitie been exerciſed in theſe pious and charitable workes in their whole life, after their ſound converſion vnto God; or out of ſelfe-loue, vaine-glory or ſeruile feare, they are performed by ſuch as haue vtterly neglected theſe workes of mercy in their life time, &amp; now would make ſome ſatisfaction for this neglect after their departure. For the former we are to iudge that it is a good concluſion of a like good premiſes, and a manifeſt ſigne of their loue towards God and their neighbours, when as they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to doe theſe workes of mercy in their life time, but alſo take care that they may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued euen after their death; and not only relieue the poore members of Chriſt whileſt they liued with them, but alſo bequeath vnto them legacies after their departure, and account them among their children and heyres, by leauing vnto them a portion with them, and a part in their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in lieu of thankfulnes towards their Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who hath made them coheyres with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his heauenly kingdome. Neither is there iuſt exceptions to be taken, if theſe workes of mercy done by them after death, doe exceede in number and quantitie thoſe which they haue done in their life time, ſeing herein they deale no otherwiſe with the poore, than with their owne children and deareſt friends, vpon whom they beſtow more by Will than euer before they had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10738:63"/> from them. And it is iuſt, that men ſhould keepe the largeſt portion of their goods while they liue for their owne maintenance, giuing to the poore what they may conueniently ſpare from this vſe; and very charitable if they deſigne a great part of their eſtate to religious and pious vſes, when as themſelues ſhall haue no further vſe of it.</p>

                  <p>But concerning the other, who haue vtterly neglected the works of mercy in the whole courſe of their liues, and thinke it ſufficient if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſomwhat for theſe vſes after their death; there is not the like iudgment. In chriſtian policie they are not abſolutely to be condemned, leaſt hereby they ſhould take occaſion to neglect the workes of mercy liuing and dying; no nor yet in chriſtian charitie, ſeeing theſe may be the after-fruits of their late repentance. Beſides, theſe good workes are aſſuredly good vnto the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; and in reſpect of the giuers thus much may be ſaid, that they do much better than thoſe who doe neglect them altogether, taking no care that any good ſhould be done either in their liues or after death. And though now they can keepe their goods no longer, yet being to part with them of neceſſitie, it is good that they make choice freely to beſtow them on theſe good vſes; wherein they are much to bee preferred before thoſe who beſtow them vpon ſuch vſes, as are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euill, ſuperfluous, ſuperſtitious, or meere worldly and carnall. Neither may they iuſtly be taxed for doing theſe good workes now, but their long delay is to be blamed, and becauſe they

                  <p>Which fault that we may auoyde, let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it is much better and more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to giue liberally to theſe good vſes in our life time, making our owne hands our executors, and our eyes our ouer-ſeers, than to leaue our goods to theſe vſes to bee diſpoſed of at the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others. According to that Eccli: 18. 22. <note place="margin">Eccli. 18. 22. 25</note> 
                     <hi>Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow in due time, and deferre not vntill death to be iuſtified. When thou haſt enough remember the time of hunger, and when thou art rich thinke vpon pouertie and neede.</hi> Secondly, it is much more acceptable to God, as being a more infallible ſigne of a ſtronger faith and more firme affiance in him. For if in our life time we giue our goods to the poore becauſe God requireth it, we therby euidently declare that we reſt vpon Gods prouidence and promiſes for our prouiſion, ſeing we diſ-furniſh our ſelues of a good part of our meanes, euen whileſt we haue occaſion to vſe them. Whereas if we keepe all to our ſelues till the honre of death, we may be well ſuſpected of diffidence and want of faith, which is the cauſe why we doe not truſt ſo much in God, as in our owne prouiſion and ſtore which we haue about vs. So alſo it is an euidence of greater loue and obedience, if at Gods commandement, and for his ſake wee can willingly part with our goods, when they are ſtill in our power, and might be conuerted to our owne vſe; than if we beſtow them to ſuch vſes, when as death approaching we can keepe them no longer. For it is a ſmall matter
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10738:64"/> to giue vnto God that, which though we would neuer ſo fayne we cannot carry with vs, and it is next to neglecting, to doe ſo late. For what great thing is it, if we be perſwaded to put off our clothes, when as we are ready to go to bed, to giue away the reliques of our meate in the Inne, when we are ready to take horſe, and to ſet forward our iourney into another country? Yea what thanks is it, if we then giue away our apparell, when we haue ſo long worne it, that it will hange on our backes no longer, and then part with our meate, when whether we will or no, it ſhall be taken from vs; eſpecially when it is done in this hope, that our rotten raggs ſhall be changed into robes of immortalitie, and our periſhing meate ſhall be ſupplyed with the bread of life?

Now are we ſayling towards to the Holy Land, and theſe works of mercy, like a good gale of winde, driue vs forward vnto the wiſhed hauen; now are we to diſpatch our ſpirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, wherein God offereth vnto vs for temporarie trifles euerlaſting treaſures; now is the time of our chriſtian warfare, wherein we are to fight againſt the deuill, the world, and our owne car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and couetous luſts, and then we ouercome the world and our ſelues, when we are wholy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp with the workes of mercy; and can part with our earthly goods, in loue towards God, and compaſſion towards our neighbours. But if we deferre them till after death, and will giue nothing to the poore till all muſt be taken from vs; it is like a faire gale of winde after ſhip wracke, as if we ſhould ſet out our wares when the market is done, &amp; make great braggs of our valour, when the fight is finiſhed and we put to flight. Beſides, the workes of mercy are beſt done when they are fitted to the occaſions and wants of thoſe vnto whom they are performed; and not to giue vnto them when their neceſſitie requireth, but when we can beſt ſpare our goods, is as if the ſteward ſhould giue foode to the familie, not at meale-times, or when they are moſt hungry, but when as himſelfe hath nothing elſe to doe; or when he can keepe the foode in his ſtore-houſe no longer,

                  <head>Sect 7. Giuing almes in our life-time moſt ſutable &amp; comely for a Chriſtian.</head>
                  <p>Fiftly, it is moſt comely and ſutable that a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable life ſhould goe before a charitable death, and it well beſeemeth a Chriſtian ſo to liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually as he meaneth to dye. For who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a pleaſant epilogue, after a direfull tragedie? or that he ſhould be pittifull, compaſſionate and liberall in the end, who in all his former courſe hath beene cruell, hard-hearted and niggardly? or that God will honour him with a cloſe of bountie and bleſſednes, who hath all his whole life diſhonored God &amp; wronged his poore Saints with his extreame miſerableneſſe and gripplenes? or how ſhall a man take his words ſpoken in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of ſicknes, <hi>I giue and bequeath pounds and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds to theſe and theſe good vſes,</hi> who would not in his whole life part with a few pence to releeue the poores neceſſitie and preſerue them from ſtaruing? who ſeeing ſuch diſſonancie and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betweene his preſent words and former practiſe, would not thinke that he raued and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked idly, rather then out of a ſetled iudgement and good deliberation? Againe, it better futeth with the nature of theſe good workes to be done by our ſelues in our life-time, then to be left vnto
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10738:66"/> the diſcretion of other to bee done by them after our death; in which reſpect our Sauiour calleth our good workes by the name of lights, to imply vnto vs, that wee muſt ſee them goe before vs, and not ſuffer them by others to be held behinde our backes.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, howſoeuer, we are to iudge charitably of ſuch actions, when we ſee them done, becauſe wee diſcerne onely the outward worke, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſearch the heart and ſecret thoughts; yet when as we ſee all on a ſudden crueltie turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mercie, and miſerly hardneſſe into profuſe bountie; the hands wide opened towards the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of death for the releefe of the poore, which haue beene cloſe ſhut in the whole life; and the workes of mercy practiſed, which alwaies before haue been vtterly neglected; there is great cauſe of iealouſie and doubting, that theſe actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not from thoſe right and religious cauſes which ſet the true Chriſtian a worke to doe the like things, but rather from ſiniſter, worldly and carnall reſpects, which haue ouerſwayed and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in the whole courſe of their liues. Not from the loue of God, Chriſtian obedience, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and mercy towards the poore; for if theſe graces had reſidence in their hearts, they would haue produced the like effects in their health and ſtrength; but rather from ſelfe loue, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with carnall feare and vaine glory; whereby they are made willing to imploy their goods to theſe pious and charitable vſes, when as they ſee they can keepe them no longer,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10738:67"/> either to eternize their names in this world by theſe long laſting monuments, or to eſcape the better before Gods iudgement ſeat, where now they muſt giue vp the account of their ſteward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to be freed from that fearefull condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the world to come. From which iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and ſuſpicion there is no means to be freed, vnleſſe theſe workes of mercy thus performed do apparantly proceede from ſerious and ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a liuely faith in Chriſt; which are ſeldome granted to any in their death-bed, who haue neglected and contemned them, through the whole courſe of their liues.</p>

                  <p>THe next point which I propounded in this duty of almeſdeedes was their properties, whereby the pious and charitable almes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which are the vndoubted ſignes of a godly and bleſſed man, may bee diſcerned, from thoſe counterfet almes which are done by hypocrites and worldlings; the which are great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. For firſt they differ in the cauſes and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines from which they ariſe and ſpring; For the almes of Chriſtians are the fruites of a liuely and and iuſtifying faith, and are done out of vnfained
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10738:67"/> loue and obedience towards God: and therefore is a Chriſtian mercifull vnto others, becauſe he is aſſured of Gods mercie to himſelfe; therefore doth he giue ſmall things to men, becauſe he hath receiued great things from God; and for this cauſe is he liberall to thoſe that neede his helpe, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue deſerued it, but becauſe God hath commanded it. So alſo his almes ſpring from Chriſtian charity, mercy and compaſſion towards the poore, becauſe hee is a member of Chriſt, and of the houſhold of faith, or at leaſt a creature of God and of the ſame fleſh. But the worldlings alms ariſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfe-loue, wherby in his almes he aimeth at ſome temporarie and earthly good to be deriued by them vnto himſelfe, out of pride and vaine-glory, that hee may bee praiſed <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> and magnified amongſt men, or may merit a farre greater reward at the hands of God, or out of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare of Gods iudgments in this life or the life to come, which by this meanes hee would auert and turne away from him; and therefore not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from true charitie they profit nothing. 1. Corinth. 13. 3. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Chriſtian ſheweth mercy, being enclined thereunto by the motion of Gods ſpirit, and the inward fountaine of goodneſſe, which is thereby wrought in him, which make him when hee wanteth occaſions of doing good, to enquire and ſeeke after them: but the worldlings mercie is the meere worke of nature, and is mooued and excited onely by the preſence of ſome miſerable obiect, which ſtirreth vp in him the naturall paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10738:68"/> of pitty for the preſent: but no ſooner is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect remooued out of ſight, but his mercie and compaſſion preſently ceaſeth.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, they differ in their ends; for the main end at which the Chriſtian aimeth in his almes, is, that God by them may be glorified; and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ends are the good of his neighbours, the adorning of his profeſſion with theſe workes of mercie, the edification of others by his Chriſtian example, his owne preſent good in the aſſurance of Gods fauour, and his future glorie in the life to come. But the hypocrite aimeth cheifely at his owne glorie and good, either for the obtaining of ſome worldly benefits, or the auoiding of ſome temporall or euerlaſting puniſhment; or finally, that hee may ſatisfie Gods iuſtice for his ſinnes, make him beholding vnto him, and merit at his hands euerlaſting happineſſe.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, they differ in the matter of their almes, firſt in reſpect of propriety; for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is liberall in giuing out of his owne ſtore wherewith God hath bleſſed him, and which he hath gotten by his honeſt labours in his lawfull calling: but the worldling giueth out of that which is other mens, and hauing raked much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by oppreſſion, extortion, deceit, vſury, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and ſuch like vnlawfull meanes, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to giue out of it ſome penny-almes, to make ſome ſatisfaction for his ſinnes, and to ſtop the crie of his conſcience, that he may more ſecurely ſleepe in his wicked courſes, and ſo more quietly goe into hell. </p>

                  <p>Fiftly, they differ in the obiect or extent, for the Chriſtians mercy extendeth to all that ſtand in neede, euen to Infidells becauſe they are Gods creatures; to their enemies, becauſe they looke not to their deſerts but to Gods commandement; but eſpecially it is exerciſed in releiuing poore Chriſtians, becauſe they are the children of God and members of Chriſt. And though they bee ready to doe good vnto all, yet chiefly to thoſe who are of the houſhold of faith: though their goodneſſe like their heauenly Fathers reacheth to the good and bad, yet eſpecially it extendeth <note place="margin">Ga. 6. 10.</note> to Gods Saints and to the excellent; and becauſe <note place="margin">Math. 5. 45.</note> it cannot extend to God himſelfe, by reaſon of <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 3.</note>

The which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall arguments are like the roote and bodie of a goodly tree, from which ſpring many boughes and branches, or like the prime anceſtours of the ſtocke ond kindred, from whom doe iſſue a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous poſterity. Which that we may the more plainely conceiue, let vs breifely examine the meaning of the words. And firſt, by <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> we are to vnderſtand, not generally all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which conſiſteth in our whole conformity to the Law, nor that whole part of Legall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which conſiſteth in obedience to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table; but certaine ſpeciall fruites of this righteouſneſſe, in the works of mercy toward the poore, by a Synecdoche of the generall for the ſpeciall: or, if you will, almeſdeedes themſelues, which (as I haue ſhewed) are by the Hebrewes called by the name of righteouſneſſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> by the name of mercy, to ſhew vnto vs, that <note place="margin">צדקה</note> it is ſuch a grace which reſteth not onely in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <note place="margin">חסד</note> habite or bare affection of the heart and minde, but alſo exerciſeth it ſelfe in the outward act of releeuing thoſe whoſe penurious eſtates we pitty and commiſerate.

                  <p>Secondly, it is not onely an act of mercy but alſo of iuſtice to giue almes to the poore, becauſe the Lord, who is the cheife owner of our goods, hauing appointed all that wee can ſpare to their vſe, it is not our owne, but their portion allotted vnto them; which they haue as good right vnto as we haue to the reſt, becauſe it is ratified vnto them by the ſame authoritie. For if wee haue right to the maine eſtate becauſe God in his bounty hath giuen it vnto vs, then they haue right alſo to the ouerplus which wee may well ſpare by vertue of the ſame donation. Onely here is the difference that God hath giuen vnto vs our riches immediately himſelfe, but vnto the poore mediately by vs, whom he hath inioyned to performe vnto them theſe duties of mercie and Chriſtian charity. In which regard as it is theft in vs to rob them of that portion which God hath alotted vnto them, ſo it is theft in the poore to take it from the rich without their conſent, ſeeing they haue the right of diſpoſing them from God; euen as it is theft in the inferiour ſeruants, if when the ſteward neglecteth his dutie in feeding and prouiding for them, they take vpon them to be their owne caruers; for as it is the will of the Maſter that he ſhould feede them, ſo alſo that they ſhould be fed by him, and not forcibly take it from him by fraud or violence.

Yea in truth that is much more acceptable which we doe for his poore members, than if we ſhould do it to his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10738:82"/> owne perſon, as being a ſigne of greater loue; for it is but an ordinarie kindnes to conferre benefits vpon our deareſt freinds, but to extend our bountie to the pooreſt and meaneſt that belong vnto them is a ſigne of much greater loue. For if for their ſakes only we do good vnto theſe, how much more would we be ready to doe it vnto them-ſelues if they had occaſion to craue our helpe? And as in this regard he much eſteemeth this chriſtian bountie, ſo alſo he will richly reward it at the day of iudgement; for then theſe merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men who haue releiued the poore for Chriſts ſake, ſhall with rauiſhing ioy heare that ſentence, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father;</hi> becauſe the workes <note place="margin">Math: 25 40.</note> of mercy which they haue done to the poore, Chriſt will acknowledge as done vnto him-ſelfe. Now what can bee a more forcible reaſon to make our hearts relent though they be neuer ſo ſtonie, and our bowells to earne with pitty and compaſſion towards the poore, though they were of braſſe and yron, than to conſider that our deare Lord and Sauiour in them doth craue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife? For who is ſo more than brutiſhly ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that can turne him away emptie-handed, who being infinitely rich in all glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was content for our ſakes to become poore, that by his pouertie he might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 9.</note> vnto vs his heauenly riches? Who would not giue Chriſt lodging, yea euen (if neede ſhould require) the vſe of his owne bed, if he remember that he was content ſo farre to abaſe himſelfe for our ſakes, as to make a ſtable his chamber, and a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10738:82"/> manger his lodging? Who could deny to clothe him being naked, who hath clothed our nakednes and couered our filthineſſe with the precious robe of his righteouſnes, in which we ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted before God and receiue the bleſſing of eternall happineſſe? Who would not ſpare food out of his owne belly to releiue poore Chriſt, who hath giuen vnto vs his bleſſed body to be our meate, and his precious blood to bee our drinke, whereby our ſoules and bodies are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vnto euerlaſting life? Who would not leaue all pleaſure and profit to goe and viſit him in his ſicknes and impriſonment, that came to viſit and redeeme vs with the ineſtimable price of himſelf, when we were inthralled in the miſerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſinne, ſathan, hell and condemnation? and to ſet vs free in that glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God, was content to be himſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended like a malefactor, impriſoned, arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, accuſed, blaſphemed, and rayled at, buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſpit vpon, whipped, crowned with thornes, condemned to death, and crucified betweene two theeues? Neither let vs excuſe our hardnes of heart in denying releefe to the poore, by ſaying, that though wee reject them, yet we would if Chriſt were in their place ſhew all loue vnto him, ſeeing this is but to couer our rockie obduratenes, with the filthy vaile of impious infidelitie. For Chriſt in his word hath plainly told vs, that what we doe to his brethren and poore members, he <note place="margin">Math. 25. 40. 45.</note> doth eſteeme as done vnto himſelfe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou ſtill refuſe to releeue the poore, either
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:10738:83"/> confeſſe thy infidelitie which will not let thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him; or thy hardnes of heart which will not ſuffer thee to releeue and comfort him.</p>

Thirdly, they are infallible ſignes of a liuely faith, whereby we may approoue it vnto men, becauſe they are thoſe good fruits which ſpring from it, according to that Iam. 2. 18. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes, and I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 18.</note>

For if we be truely aſſured of Gods loue towards vs, we will vndoubtedly loue him againe; and if wee loue him vnfainedly, wee will alſo loue our neighbours for his ſake, and be readie to ſhew all duties of loue to all thoſe that need our helpe. So alſo they are in this regard ſignes of a liuely faith, ſeeing thereby we apprehend Gods promiſes, &amp; ſo are encouraged to doe theſe workes of mercie for his ſake; for no man eaſily parteth with his worldly goods to theſe vſes, vnleſſe by faith he be aſſured that he ſhal haue in lue of them heauenly and euerlaſting treaſures. Fourthly, they are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10738:86"/> vndoubted ſignes of our loue towardes God, whenas we ſo loue the poore for his ſake, as that we be content to ſpare ſomewhat euen from our owne backes and bellies, that wee may the more liberally communicate vnto their neceſſities. And as our almes are a ſigne of our loue to God, ſo the quantitie of our almes (reſpect being had to the proportion of our ſtate) is a ſigne of the quantity of our loue; for he loueth but little, that hauing much, giueth but little, and contrariwiſe his hart is inflamed with feruent loue, who hath it inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with bountie towards his poore brethren; the extenſion of our loue towards them, being the true touchſtone of the intention of our loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. And as a great tree, with many and large branches are an vndoubted ſigne of a roote proportionable in greatneſſe; and a ſmall ſhrub aboue the ground, plainly proueth that the roote alſo is ſmall which is vnder it; ſo is it with our loue and almes-deedes which ſpring from it; for if we be bountifull in almes, wee are plentifull in loue, if we be ſlacke in giuing, wee are cold in louing; but if we be vtterly defectiue in bringing foorth theſe excellent fruites, then it is a manifeſt ſigne that this grace of Gods loue is not rooted in vs. <hi>For if any man haue theſe worlds goods, and ſeeth his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>brother haue need, and ſhutteth vp his bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi> And as they are manifeſt ſignes of our loue towards God, ſo alſo of our loue towards our neighbours, when as wee carry ourſelues in all Chriſtian bounty towards them, as vnto children
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10738:86"/> of the ſame father, and members of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuffering with them in their wants, through compaſſion and fellow-feeling, and reioycing with them in their fulneſſe and proſperity. And as they are plaine demonſtrations of our faith and loue, ſo alſo direct proofes of their ſincerity and truth, and that they are not hypocriticall and counterfet. In which regard the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bringeth the Corinthians to this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of almeſdeeds, <hi>to prooue the ſinceritie of their</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 8. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>loue.</hi> 2. Cor. 8. 8. And againe verſe 24. <hi>Shew yee to them, and before the Churches the proofe of your loue.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> alſo plainely affirmeth, that it is but an vnprofitable and hypocritical loue, to make ſhew of kindneſſe and compaſſion in word, and to performe nothing in deede. Iam. 2. 15. Fifthly, theſe almeſdeedes are notable ſignes <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 15.</note> whereby we may bee comfortably aſſured of the remiſſion of our ſinnes. For though they bee not cauſes of pardon, by ſatisfying Gods iuſtice (as the Papiſts abſurdly teach) yet are they teſtimonies vnto vs, that they are pardoned; for our mercy towards the poore ariſeth from the aſſurance which wee firſt haue of Gods mercy towards vs; &amp; as our giuing much to Chriſts poore members for his ſake, doth ſhew that wee loue much (for if wee doe this to the feete, how much more would we doe it to our head himſelfe?) ſo our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing much is an infallible ſigne that many ſinnes are forgiuen vs, as our Sauiour ſpeaketh to the woman, Luk. 7. 27. Laſtly, by theſe almeſdeedes <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 47.</note> and workes of mercy, we may be aſſured that we
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10738:87"/> are godly and bleſſed men, ſound Chriſtians, and true citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem; for heere in this Pſalme it is made a note and propertie of a bleſſed &amp; good man (not as the world ſpeakes, to haue goods in poſſeſſion, for <hi>Diues</hi> in the Parable was ſuch a good man, and yet afterwards caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell) but to do good by giuing to the poore, &amp; releeuing the poore members of Ieſus Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Prou. 14. 21. <hi>Hee that hath mercie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 14. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>on the poore, happie is hee.</hi> And without the doing of theſe workes of mercy, wee can haue no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that we are now good men, and ſubiects of the kingdome of grace, or ſhall heereafter be citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of heauen.

For ſeeing we haue ſo many gracious and infallible promiſes from God himſelfe, that if we giue to others, we ſhall receiue from him; if we let the ſtreames of our liberalitie water the dry and thirſtie lands into which hee would haue them run, they ſhall againe be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the all-ſufficient fountaine of his bounty, why ſhould we reſtraine and with-hold our almes from the poore in the time of neede? or why ſhould we giue vnto them with a ſtraite and niggardly hand? why ſhould we hazard the drying vp of our breaſts, which are only reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from God with his bleſſings, by refuſing to communicate them to the vſe of his children, and not let the poore draw them which is the only
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:10738:89"/> meanes to preſerue their fullnes and plenty? why ſhould wee aſſuredly loſe our riches for feare of loſing them; and not rather ſeeme to loſe them, that we may in truth finde them? according to that, Eccli: 29. 10. <hi>Loſe thy money for thy brother and thy freind, and let it not ruſt vnder a ſtone to be lost.</hi>

For if we keepe it in our graners, it will either be ſpent in the vſe, or in time muſte, corrupt, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but if we caſt it into the ground, where it ſeemeth to rott and to be loſt, it is the onely way to preſerue and keepe it from loſing and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. And therfore let vs not, by giuing to the poore, feare the loſſe of our riches, ſeeing it is the beſt and ſafeſt courſe to preſerue them for our vſe; whereas otherwiſe they cannot be without perill of miſcarying. But let this conſideration moue vs to giue more freely and liberally, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting herein wiſe Trauaylors, who being in a ſtrange and dangerous country, will not carry their riches and treaſures about them, becauſe they then be in danger by theeues and enemies to be ſpoyled of them, hazarding alſo there with
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:10738:89"/> the loſſe of their liues, but deliuer them rather to the Agents and Factors of ſufficient Merchants dwelling in their owne country, that ſo taking from them bills of exchange, they may receiue them at their comming home; ſo let not vs carry about vs all our wealth and riches whileſt we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in our worldly pilgrimage, where we are ſtill in perill to be robbed by theeues and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and though we eſcape many dangers, yet are ſure at laſt to be ſpoyled, when death our mortall enemie ſhall ſet vpon vs. But let vs put a good part of our goods (euen as much as we can well ſpare from our owne vſe for the well fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of our iourney) into the hands of the poore, whom God hath appointed as his agents and factors, and ſo it ſhall moſt ſurely be repayed, when hauing finiſhed our pilgrimage, we ſhall ſafely arriue at our heauenly home; and though whileſt we are trauayling we haue it not in ſight but ſeeme for the time to be diſpoſſeſſed of it; yet in the end we ſhall finde that it was not loſt, but ſent before vs, and that it only remaineth for our vſe and benefit, when death hath ſpoyled vs of all the reſt. And this is the right courſe to make vs <hi>freinds of the vnrighteous Mammon,</hi> vnto which our Sauiour perſwadeth vs, Luc. 16. 9. This is to play the wiſe ſtewards, that when by <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 9.</note> death we are thruſt out of our ſtewardſhip, we hauing diſcreetly laid out our maſters goods may be ioyfully receiued into thoſe euerlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>

                  <p>The other obiection is, that if we be ſo liberall
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10738:90"/> in giuing to the poore, we ſhall hereby conſume <note place="margin">Their obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anſwered who ſay that by giuing almes their eſtates will be conſumed, and they brought vnto penurie.</note> our eſtate, and ſo our ſelues be brought into pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurie. To which I anſwer, that we muſt in this regard order our affaires with chriſtian diſcretion, and deliuer ſo much to be ſent before vs, as that we our ſelues doe not want neceſſaries for our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt occaſions and the well finiſhing of our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which being obſerued there is no cauſe why we ſhould feare pouertie by releiuing the poore. The wiſe husbandman doth not caſt all his ſeede into the ground, but reſerueth ſo much at leaſt as will be ſufficient to maintaine his familie; and ſo we muſt ſow not all we haue, but all which we can ſpare, that through our indiſcretion we want not foode before the time of harueſt. And this is all I deſire (ſaith the couetous miſer) but ſeeing my goods are ſubiect to many caſualties, and I may haue many extraordinarie occaſions which may bring me into want, I will not part with much, becauſe I will be ſure to leaue ſufficient for my ſelfe. Yea but how will thy hourding vp of riches preſerue thee from theſe perills, and not rather through Gods iuſt iudgement expoſe thee vnto them, becauſe thou diſobeyeſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, through diffidence and diſtruſt in his prouidence and reſting vpon thine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion? Or how canſt thou tell when thou haſt ſufficient to maintaine thee and thy charge? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Hag: 1. 9.</note> if God doe but blow vpon thy wealth, all, as well as a part, will vaniſh away and giue thee no warning when it departeth? In which regard how much better were it to vſe things preſent, and to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10738:90"/> commend our ſelues and our eſtates without carking and caring vnto God who careth for vs, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 7. Heb. 13. 5.</note> and is all-ſufficient to ſupply all our wants, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo many faithfull promiſes that he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for vs and repay vs what in obedience to his commandement we lay out, on theſe charitable vſes. And this argument the Apoſtle vſeth, to perſwade the Corinthians to giue liberally to the vſe of the poore, 2 Cor: 9. 8. <hi>Becauſe God</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 8.</note> he) <hi>is able to make all grace abound towards you, that you alwaies hauing all ſufficiencie in all things may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to euery good worke. Now he that miniſtreth ſeede to the ſower, doth miniſter bread for your foode, and multiplyeth your ſeede ſowne, and increaſeth the fruits of your righteouſneſſe.</hi> Whereby is ſignified, that he who inableth vs to giue vnto the poore, is as able to prouide things neceſſary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable for our vſe in this life preſent, and ſo to bleſſe our ſeeds of beneficence, which we haue ſowne by his direction and appointment, as that wee may reape a fruitfull harueſt in the life to come. And as he is able ſo wee ſhall finde him willing; neither are we to imagine that if we be carefull in feeding Chriſt, that he will be careleſſe in feeding vs; that hee will deny vs meate who hath giuen vs his precious blood; that he will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to want earthly trifles, who hath prouided for vs heauenly riches. Let ſuch more than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh diffidence be farre from vs who profeſſe our ſelues to be of the houſhold of faith, and if we will be thought worthy the name of Chriſtians, let vs not ſo much diſtruſt the promiſes of Chriſt.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10738:91"/> As therefore no husbandman refuſeth to ſow his ſeede in due ſeaſon for feare of want, but leſt he ſhould want will therfore ſowe it; ſo let not feare of pouertie make vs poore in theſe works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but let vs ſowe our almes-deeds with a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand in aſſured hope of fruitfull increaſe. For by whoſe prouidence and prouiſion doe we liue and are we maintayned? Is it our owne, and not rather Gods, whoſe power ruleth ouer all, and whoſe eye neuer ſleepeth? Is it not he who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs all things to enioy; and preſerueth the things giuen, when they are expoſed to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perills?

The which conſideration ſhould make vs bountifull in doing theſe workes of mercie, ſeeing we haue much more benefit by the almes we giue, than our poore brethren who doe receiue them. For they are the ground into which theſe ſeeds are caſt, and we the husbandmen who diſperſe and ſcatter them; now as ſeede is chiefly for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit who ſoweth it, and not for the benefit of the ground into which it is caſt; ſo the poore haue but the preſent vſe and poſſeſſion of this ſeede of almes-deeds, but the benefit of the happy and heauenly harueſt belongeth to thoſe good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, who ſowe in theſe grounds the feedes of their beneficence. Let vs not then grudge to giue almes to the poore when we haue fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but rather do them with ioy, and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto God, who hath giuen vs fit oportunity of ſowing our ſeede, that ſo we may reape a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full harueſt. For what husbandman would not readily and cherefully harken to one who ſhould offer vnto him fertile and fruitfull land, ready prepared and manured, to ſowe his ſeede in, with a faithfull promiſe that he ſhould reap the whole crop for his owne vſe and benefit? But thus God dealeth with vs when he giueth vs oportunitie of releiuing the poore: yea in truth much better &amp;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10738:92"/> more liberally. For though a man ſhould freely receiue of another, land to ſow his ſeede in, yet he were not ſure of a fruitfull harueſt, for many accidents happen, which cut off the hopes of the moſt skilfull husband-man, as froſts and mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewes, wormes and locuſts, tares and weeds, too much wet, or too much drought, may deſtroy the corne, though the ſeede were neuer ſo good; or when it is readie for the ſickle, the enemie may come and reape it: but if wee ſow theſe ſeedes of our beneficence, beleeuing Gods promiſes and hoping for an happy harueſt, we ſhall neuer faile of our expectation, becauſe God who is infinite in power and truth, hauing promiſed a fruitfull crop, no outward accident is able to hinder it. And although our Almeſdeedes ſeeme (like the ſeede ſowne) to periſh and rot, yet beleeuing what we ſee not, we ſhall aſſuredly ſee what wee beleeue, and finde ſuch a fruitfull increaſe in our heauenly harueſt; as wee ſhall conclude, that much greater benefit redounded to vs who gaue, then vnto the poore who were the receiuers of our almes.</p>

But the onely meanes to haue the fruit and benefit of our riches for euer, is to ſend them before vs into our heauenly countrey, where wee ſhall haue our euerlaſting habitation, and the beſt meanes of tranſporting them thither, is to deliuer them vnto the poore, who like truſty porters will carrie them for vs, for if wee carry them our ſelues, they will, like heauie burthens, hinder our iourney, and like the camels bunch, keepe vs from entring into the ſtraight gate; whereas if the poore whom God hath appointed for this ſeruice carry them for vs, we ſhall auoyd the trouble, and eſcape this danger. The which ſhould be a forcible argument to moue vs with a bountifull hand to giue vnto the poore, ſeeing whatſoeuer is ſo giuen is ſent before vs, and whatſoeuer is hourded vp in our cheſts is loſt and left behinde vs. And what folly is this, there to leaue thy wealth whence thou art departing, and not to ſend it before thee whether thou art going? to leaue and looſe thy riches in thy Inne and the

Yea but thou ſeeſt not this increaſe in thy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtate by giuing almes. And if thou beleeueſt no more than thou ſeeſt, why doſt thou take vpon thee the name of a Chriſtian, who liueth by faith rather than by ſenſe? For by how many ſecret paſſages can God conueigh vnto thee the reward of thy almeſdeeds, though he writeth no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription vpon them, to certifie thee for what it is ſent? it is ſufficient that thou haſt it, and that thou knoweſt that he ſent it, as for the reaſons which moued him to giue theſe benefits vnto thee, he will acquaint thee with them more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, when as he ſhall call thee to make vp thy <note place="margin">Math. 25. 34.</note> reckoning.

Finally, if thou ſayeſt that thou ſeeſt no poſſibilitie of increaſing thy wealth by giuing away a great part of it vnto the poore: I anſwer, and what more reaſon haſt thou by the collection of ſenſe, that thy ſeede which thou ſoweſt ſhould be multiplyed, which thou caſteſt away and letteſt rott in the earth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou hadſt learned it by experience? And is not Gods word a much more infallible teacher &amp; ſurer ground for thy faith to reſt vpon, eſpecially when thou art not without experience of the like increaſe ſpringing from the ſowing of the ſeeds of thy beneficence?

Concerning the former, the benefit of our almeſdeedes is very great, for whereas our riches are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moſt flitting, mutable and inconſtant, they being euery day redie to leaue vs, or we them; by giuing of almes they are preſerued for our vſe: whereas like an Eagle they are ſtill ready to flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs, as the wiſe man ſpeaketh, Prou. 23. <note place="margin">Prou. 23, 5.</note> 5. by this meanes their wings are clipped, ſo as they cannot take their flight nor depart from vs. In which reſpect that conceipt ſhould not hinder vs from giuing almes which hindereth many,

And thus it is ſaid Pſal. 18. 2. <hi>The Lord is my rocke and my fortreſſe, and my deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, my God, my ſtrength in whom I will truſt, my buckler, and the horne of my ſaluation, and my high tower.</hi> By all which borrowed ſpeaches the ſame thing is ſignified, namely that the Lord was his chiefe ſtrength by whom hee had ſafety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence maugre the malice of all his enemies. So Pſal. 75. 10. <hi>All the hornes of the wicked will I cut</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 75. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>off, but the hornes of the righteous ſhall bee exalted.</hi> By which is meant that he would diſable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the one, and aduance and confirme the proſperitie of the other. And thus the Apoſtle expoundeth theſe wordes; for perſwading the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be bountifull in doing theſe works of mercie, hee taketh away a ſecret obiection which might hinder them in their liberality, namely that hereby they ſhould impoueriſh their eſtates, and bring themſelues to want: aſſuring them that there was no cauſe to feare this, <hi>for God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is able to make all grace abound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, that yee alwaies hauing all ſufficiencie in</hi>

And thus alſo the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to thoſe that <hi>draw out their ſoule to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie and ſatisfie the afflicted ſoule, that hee will guide them continually, ſatisfie their ſoule in drought and make fat their bones; and that they ſhall be like a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered garden, and like a ſpring of water whoſe waters faile not.</hi> Eſa. 58. 10. 11.

                  <p>AND thus haue I propounded many and weighty reaſons, whereby we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to exerciſe our ſelues in the works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to be bountifull in relieuing the poore members of Ieſus Chriſt. Now it only remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we anſwer ſome obiections, which we haue not met with in the former diſcourſe, and which, like blockes in the way, hinder men from entring into, or going forward in this chriſtian courſe. And of theſe ſome reſpect the giuer, and ſome the poore who are the receiuers. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former; ſome will giue no almes, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they are poore themſelues, and haue nothing for them when they craue reliefe. And ſurely many of them ſpeake more truly than they are aware, for though they abound with earthly riches, yet are they bare and beggarly in reſpect of the chiefe riches and ſpirituall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; though they are rich in goods, yet they are poore in grace, poore in loue towards God and their neighbours, poore in faith and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and poore in pitty, mercy and compaſſion towards their brethren, which maketh them ſo niggardly and cloſe-handed, that they will part
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:10738:109"/> with nothing for their reliefe. But herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they thinke themſelues rich enough, and contrariwiſe they pretend that they are poore in worldly wealth, wherein they haue not only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, but alſo ſuperfluitie &amp; abundance. For theſe who haue nothing for the poore w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> craue reliefe, haue plenty &amp; too much to beſtow vpon idle, vnprofitable and wicked vſes. They haue not for the poore a few ſcraps to preſerue them from periſhing with hunger, but they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for themſelues to pamper their bellies, and with the rich glutton to fare delicately euery day. They haue inough to entertaine their rich freinds with ſuperfluous pompe and plenty; and they who will not leaue them to their owne appetite, but preſſe them with their importunitie to eate ſtill more, when already they haue eaten inough and too much, will not allow ſome ſmall pittance to the poore to keep them from famiſhing. They who make no ſpare of their moſt coſtly wines, but ſwallow them downe themſelues with great exceſſe; and prouoke, yea euen compell others to drinke of them vnto drunkennes, will not giue a little ſmall drinke to the poore members of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to quench their thirſt. They haue not for the poore ſome out-worne and caſt apparell to couer their nakednes, and keepe their bodies from the iniuries of the winde and weather; but they haue inough not only for their owne vſe, but alſo for pride and oſtentation; their cheſts full thruſt of rich clothing, and their wardrops throughly furniſhed with gorgeous garments,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10738:109"/> which ſerue for little other vſe, than to keep thoſe from ſloth and idleneſſe, that keepe them from moulding and moth-eating; and whereas they haue no courſe clothes to couer naked Chriſt, they haue coſtly ornaments for their walls of Arras and Tapeſtry. Finally, they haue not a few pence to ſpare for the relieuing of thoſe who are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſitie; but they haue many ſhillings and pounds to ſpend waſtfully and riotouſly, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dicing &amp; gaming, vaine ſights, obſcaene ſtage playes, and vpon all other ſinfull pleaſures and worldly delights which their carnall appetite any way deſireth. But what a fearefull account haue theſe men to make in the day of iudgment, when as they ſhall make their reckoning vnto God, <hi>Item</hi> ſo much ſpent in exceſſe and ſuperfluitie, and ſo little in performing the workes of mercy; ſo much laid out vpon worldly vanities and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures, and ſo little for good vſes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for relieuing Chriſt in his poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10738:110"/> if carnall wicked men will make ſale of ſuch things, rather than they will want that which is ſufficient for the ſatisfying of their ſinfull luſts, how much more ſhould we doe it for the better performance of theſe chriſtian duties?

Finally, though it were granted that thou had'ſt nothing to ſell, yet God commandeth thee rather then that thou ſhould'ſt neglect theſe works of mercy, to labour with thy hands, that thou mayeſt haue <note place="margin">Eph: 4. 28.</note> to giue vnto him that needeth; and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe not thy neglect of this duty, by ſaying that thou haſt nothing for them, vnleſſe thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to waſte vpon thy ſuperfluous vanities, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which thou canſt ſpare from thy neceſſarie vſe, and ſell for theſe charitable imployments; yea vnles thou art not only poore in eſtate, but impotent and vnable by thy honeſt labours to earne thy liuing, and haſt both an empty purſe and alſo ſhaking hands and weake knees, and in a word art thy ſelfe ſuch a one as needeth by others to be helped and relieued.</p>

                  <p>Yea but there are many richer, and therefore this dutie of giuing almes lyeth rather vpon them than vpon thee, who art but poore and of ſmall meanes in compariſon of them, and if they neglect to giue, much more mayeſt thou (as thou ſuppoſeſt) and yet be excuſed before God. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:10738:110"/> firſt, that none are excepted, but euery one is to giue according to his abilitie; wherein if thou faileſt, their neglect will not excuſe thee, for their example is no preſident, but euery one muſt beare their owne ſinne. Secondly, if hauing little, thou art content in obedience to God, to part with ſomewhat, thou performeſt a duty the more acceptable to God, and in the day of Chriſts appearing, thou ſhalt be ſo much the more richly rewarded; and for the preſent, thy worke ſhall be ſo much the more commendable: as we ſee in the example of the poore widdow and the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are ſo much commended for parting with ſomewhat out of their ſmall ſtore. Thirdly, if thou wilt not liue by precepts but by examples, why doeſt thou propound them for thy patterne, who are carnall and couetous, and not rather the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, and the holy men of God, whoſe bounty euen out of their pouertie, is for this very purpoſe recorded in the Scriptures? Laſtly, thou muſt conſider, if thou art poore, that almeſdeedes are a notable meanes to make thee richer, as being a ſpirituall kinde of husbandrie and merchandize, wherein if we labor and trade, wee ſhall thereby haue our wealth increaſed. Now no man in his right wits hauing ſmall ſtore of corne will omit to ſow it, becauſe others neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſeaſonable ſeede-time who haue greater plenty; no wiſe merchant will refuſe to trade and lay out his money vpon a good bargaine, becauſe thoſe who haue greater ſtockes will not imploy them, but ſo much the rather they will ſow and
